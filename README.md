# automation_beta

This repository automates the end-to-end processing of sales data — from ETL (extract, transform, load) of raw sales files through to the creation and maintenance of analytical tables used for reporting and analysis. It contains pipeline definitions, transformation scripts, validation checks, and deployment/configuration for analytical table setup to ensure reproducible, monitored, and automated sales analytics.
